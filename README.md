# Embed the Flanker Task in a Qualtrics survey
[Before using this code, watch the tutorial video to see how it all works together](https://youtu.be/B4vm5XLb8Jw)

The **reaction_time** and **rounds.js** files are slightly adapted versions of the template flanker task on Volunteer Science. You can either use the template and add the changes made in these files or upload these files into a blank study. If you upload the files into a blank study, you will have to create the variables in the custom variables tab to have them used in your study. 

In Qualtrics, just upload the **Flanker_Embed_Test.qsf** file to get your own working version of the survey.
