# Embed the Flanker Task in a Qualtrics survey
[Before using this code, watch the tutorial video to see how it all works together](https://youtu.be/B4vm5XLb8Jw)

The **reaction_time** and **rounds.js** files are slightly adapted versions of the template flanker task on Volunteer Science. You can either use the template and add the changes made in these files or upload these files into a blank study. If you upload the files into a blank study, don't forget to add the flanker variables in the custom variables tab. 

In Qualtrics, just upload the **Flanker_Embed_Test.qsf** file to get your own working version of the survey component. Make sure you update the join_category url to use the public url for your version of the Flanker task.
